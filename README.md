# Bowling_Chatbot
Team assignment for final project submission. Frank, Kayla, Harry,  and Trevor all played 9 frames of bowling at Hooplah's. By varying the throw height and speed and collecting data on the number of pins each member hits per throw, we created a chatbot that can help give advice to a user on how to improve their throw.

**Problem Statement:** We want to design an app with a user chatbot interface that allows the user to obtain advice on how they can improve their throw for a better score in bowling.

**Input and Output Variables:** Features (Player, Height, Speed). Targets (Pins hit)

**Machine Learning Algorithm(s):** SGD, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, MLP, SVR, XGBoost, Extra Trees ML algorithms all cross-validated using 5-fold cross validation. 

**Ethics Considerations:** Bowling Advice Chatbot Ethics Checklist and Data Card .pdf file uploaded in GitHub repository

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** (https://huggingface.co/spaces/kaylayi18/chatbox)

**Dataset:** Dataset was created 12/13 at Hooplah's and is in the Github Repository in the raw form. EDA and preprocessing steps were applied.
